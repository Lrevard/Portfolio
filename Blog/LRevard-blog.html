            <h2 id="About"> Discovering Video Games</h2>
            <p>Growing up, I was first introduced to video games by watching my father and older brother play games like Deus Ex, Baldur's Gate, and Final Fantasy. Seeing an interactive story filled with a mysterious world you're able to explore seemed almost mystical, more than reading it in a book.</p>
            <p>Playing video games gave a feeling of accomplishment. Seeing that game over screen with credits unfortunately brought the story to the end; however, seeing the main character and his companions experience hardships and how they persevered and eventually brought their journey to a successful end, fills the player with satisfaction similar to reading one in a good book</p>

            <h2>Why Video Games Inspire Me</h2>
            <p>Video games are capable of telling many kinds of stories, some sad, some happy, and most with lessons to learn. Video games can also become a way to learn and discover new ideas or concepts, some with creative avenues like Minecraft, which holds a sandbox element, allows for the player to create things like villages or castles.</p>
            <p>Some video games are capable of multiplayer opportunities enabling players from across the country or world to interact with each other, potentially past language barriers.</po>
